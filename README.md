The learning objective of this lab is understand the impact of collision attacks, and damages if a widely-used one-way hash function’s collision-resistance property is broken.

To achieve this goal, I launched actual collision attacks against the MD5 hash function.

Using the attacks, I created two different programs that share the same MD5 hash but have completely different behaviors. 

This lab covers a number of topics described in the following:
• One-way hash function, MD5
• The collision-resistance property
• Collision attacks


Lab environemnt: LINUX/UNIX - #Ubuntu
